    <section id="About me">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a student with a growing interest in Website Development and Soft Skills. I am currently learning the fundamentals of programming, especially Python and C, along with core concepts of web development. I enjoy understanding how websites are built and how user-friendly interfaces are designed.

        Alongside technical skills, I am also working on improving my soft skills such as communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and time management. I believe that both technical knowledge and soft skills are important for becoming a successful developer.

        I prefer learning through practical examples, coding exercises, and real-world projects. My goal is to become a skilled web developer who can create efficient, responsive, and user-friendly websites while maintaining strong professional communication and collaboration skills.
